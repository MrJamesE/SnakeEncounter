          <li>Of the more than 3,000 known species of snake on the planet, only 600 are venomous.</li>
          <p>
          <li>Snakes have no desire to harm humans!
            They bite for only two reasons: self-defense and feeding.</li>
          <p>
          <li>Snakes are ectothermic, meaning they must heat their bodies from external sources. 
            There are however a few species of snake which use vibrational friction to warm their
            eggs such as reticulated pythons, African rock pythons and Burmese pythons.</li>
          <p>
          <li>By feeding, snakes help to control many species of animal which if overpopulated are harmful to our crops and the ecosystem.</li>
          <p>
          <li>With each example containing more than 100 compounds, snake venom is a valueable resource in drug development! Venom has been used in medicine for thousands of years, and continues to be explored today.</li>
          <p>
          <li>Snakes are native to every content besides Antarctica, and cover much of the globe except for some islands such as Greenland, Ireland and New Zealand.</li>

                    <li>It has been believed that a large snake may stretch their body out against a human to see if they would be able to eat that person. Snakes do not size up their meals, but they do like warmth. If you wake up in the morning and your Burmese python is laying next to you, it's because you are warm and bed is comfortable!</li>
                    <p>
                      <li>Snakes have sometimes been thought to be slimey. They are usually covered in scales for protection which may be smooth or keeled, but neither is slimey. With specific breeding scaleless snakes have been produced, but these individuals also lack slime.</li>
                      <p>
                        <li>Some snakes have a narrow, vertical pupil much like a cat. It's a common misconception that this is indicative of a venomous snake, but that's not the case. Instead, the pupil shape tells us what time of day the animal is most active!</li>

 <h3 id="encounters">Encountering Snakes</h3>
        <ul id="tribute-encounters" class="catagories">     
            <li>Always learn which species of snakes are native to your surroundings, particularly if there are venomous snakes in your area.</li>
            <p>
              <li>Never touch a snake unless you are entirely sure which species you are looking at.</li>
              <p>
              <li>If you see a snake with cloudy, blue/white eyes, it means this snake is preparing to shed their skin. At this time their vision is reduced, meaning they will likely be more fearful and possibly resistant to handling.</li>
              <p>
                <li>When handling a snake, be very gentle and always support the body weight carefully. Never squeeze tightly, as this will understandably cause the snake to panic.</li>
                <p>
                  <li>When interacting with large constrictors such as Burmese and reticulated pythons, be sure to have someone with you just in case. These snakes are often gentle but are also incredibly powerful and may unintentionally cause harm.</li>
                  <p>
                    <li><span id="trouble" class="emergency"><i>EMERGENCY</i> </span>If you or someone else is being bitten and/or constricted by a snake (such as in a mistaken feeding response), remain calm and do not fight the snake. Nibbling or pinching the end of a constrictor's tail will usually cause the animal to uncoil. Apply mouthwash or hand sanitizer to the mouth of the snake and they will release their bite.</li>
                    <p>
                      <li><span class="emergency"><i>EMERGENCY</i> </span>If you're bitten by a venomous snake, it's usually wise to seek emergency medical care. Be sure to identify the species that bit you, as this can help determine treatment. Remain as calm as possible, and remove any jewelry in case of swelling. Do not try to suck out the venom. If possible, keep the wound below the level of your heart. If bitten by a snake with necrotic venom (e.g. a copperhead), do not apply a tourniquet as this will concentrate the venom and worsen tissue damage. </li>

                          Snakes are amazing and often misunderstood creatures. Usually when a snake harms a human being it's simply because they were afraid! Fear is also the reason we harm them. The majority of snake species we encounter are completely harmless, and even deadly snakes have no desire to hurt anything other than their food. Snakes are significant contributers to medical science, vital helpers to the ecosystem, and in captivity many species make excellent pets or reptile ambassadors! If you don't like snakes, simply leave them alone and they'll return the favor. But if you do love snakes, be educated and responsible because these awesome reptiles need all the help they can get!</li>
